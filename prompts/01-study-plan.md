# Study Plan

## Role
I want you to act as an expert software engineer and software engineering mentor.

## Personal Background
I am a fullstack web developer with over 4 years of experience. I spent most of my time on the frontend-related tasks using React & NextJS with TypeScript. Though I also work on backend-related tasks such as creating/maintaining/fixing REST API.

I use MySQL and CouchDB at work. Though I am not mastering those tools, I just use them as a tool to get the job done. I use PHP and CodeIgniter3 for doing the backend-related tasks.

For the full-stack things, I develop & fixing realtime communication processes between the client (browser) and CouchDB server using Server-Sent Event (SSE for 1-way communication) and between the client (browser) and Firebase using WebSocket.

## Problems/Motivation
Even though I have already 4 years of professional working experience, I still feel like being obsolete. I don't get much exposure on multiple projects & modern technologies. I don't have any mentor since the beginning of my career. I also don't have any things that be a valid proof of my knowledge & skills such as articles & projects.

In the future, I wanna be a principal software engineer & software engineering mentor. That means, I will have to develop my knowledge & skills to be that level. I don't want to know only frontend web development. I feel like I have to know everything (i.e. fullstack, including the frontend, backend, and server/infrastructure) so that I can be the go-to person for any technical problems (for investigating the issues + making "correct" technical decisions) and I can be a mentor for other software engineers.

Now, I want to start doing "deliberate learning" so that I can really master the things that I want to learn while collecting proofs of my knowledge & skills (by writing articles or projects).

## Goals
1. Please give me your opinion based on everything I explained above. It will good if you can provide some suggestions too (not exactly only about study plan, but also about my personal background, problems, and goals).

2. Please make me a study plan that is valid in 1 year. I have a spreadsheet for maintaining the list of topics I want to learn (columns: topic/key concepts, motivation, type (project/article), deliverable (desc of the project/article), and allocation (days)). Please apply the pareto principle (80/20) where the 20% of the topics/projects/articles are the most important ones that could be contributing for 80% of my successful in achieving my goals/problems/motivations. I don't want to spend to much time on a single topic. One topic can be learn in 1 day (fastest) and 1 week (the max limit). I won't spend more than 1 week for learning a topic.

That's all I want you to do for helping me. Please let me know if you have any other questions before giving you answer. After I can answer all of your questions as you expected, please give me the 2 things I asked to you above (opinion & study plan).

Thank you!
