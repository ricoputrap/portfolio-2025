## A. Market
You should find the right market. This could be anything. For example, the "right country", where the place is chill, the money is good, the laws are friendly & beneficial for the employee. Some countries in Europe such as Netherland, Germany, and Norway can be considered as a good market.

## B. Industry
You should pick the industry where the money is good (i.e. stable) and you can be chilling, not always being rushed to work. Some industries include:
- Tech (e.g. Google, Meta)
- Finance (e.g. Stripe)

## C. Company
You should find a big company where you can choose in which organization in the company you want to join, specifically in the organization where it can generate money.

Don't join the organization that is related to "tooling" because it is far from "money". It will be difficult to quantify/diversify our work if the place is not a money generator.

After that, you should choose a good manager that is fun and is not only a line manager anymore. The manager should be a higher manager that already knows how to do politics. So that you will only need to convince 1 person, the manager, if you want to become "Gabut". No need to convinces everyone, even the whole organization.

Finally, pick the right team/product.

## C. Earn or Learn
You should either EARN or LEARN. It's very good if you can do both! But at least, you should do one of them. Otherwise, better to find another company!

### C.1. Good Company for Learning
1. The company should have a clear promotion path. They should have a kind of company guideline or performance review guideline and set of expectations for each level. If those things exist, that means the leadership has been thinking about how to grow their employees.
2. The place where it has good managers.
3. The founders are ex-Google, ex-Meta, ex-Gojek, or ex-big-good-companies.

### C.2. Good Company for Earning
1. Offering stock options.
2. Good finance. Money maker.
