## Introduction

Last year, I wrote a tutorial on deploying a static website using Caddy. That was my first experience working with a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and Caddy. In that tutorial, I covered the steps necessary to configure a web server using both Caddy and Docker. However, I found that Docker is not essential for deploying a static website.

In this tutorial, I will demonstrate a simpler method for deploying a static website using only Caddy and the files for our website. 

Although we are dealing with a static website, it's important to recognize that updates will likely be necessary over time. For example, as I am currently writing this tutorial, I am preparing to update my website's content. Therefore, understanding how to update our website effectively is crucial.
