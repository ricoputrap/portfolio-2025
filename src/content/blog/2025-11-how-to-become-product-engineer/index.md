## How to become a product engineer?

Based on the "Product Engineer 101" course taught by [mas Gogo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwastuargo/), there are some tips to become a product engineer.

### A. Communication
1. Do not hide behind your manager
2. Ask feedback from anyone (_product engineers, C levels, clients, 3rd parties, etc_)
3. Write more (twitter, blog, reports). Learn storytelling

### B. Product Sense
1. Look and understand business, product, and engineering metrics of your team.
2. Start hypothesizing/proposing about project/product ideas.
3. Engage in user research and customer support.
4. Use the product!
5. Learn SQL, cohort analysis, metabase, and mixpanel/amplitude. Do business and product metrics queries yourself.

### C. Pragmatism
Offer product-engineering tradeoffs. Give options/solutions for any problems as many as possible.
