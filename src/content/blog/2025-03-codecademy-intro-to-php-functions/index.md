![PHP Function Syntax](/codecademy-php-functions.png)

1. We can package a set of instructions within a named function to reuse whenever we’d like.
2. When we invoke a function, the computer will execute the function body, specified by the code block following the parameters list.
3. Functions can return a value by using the return keyword otherwise they return NULL which means no value.
4. We can store the return value of a function in a variable or use it any other way we’d use a value.
5. We can define functions with parameters which are variables we can refer to throughout our function’s body.
6. When invoking functions, the values that we give them are called arguments.
7. Functions can have multiple parameters.
8. The order in which the arguments are passed in decides which parameters they correspond to.
9. You can make an argument optional by providing its corresponding parameter with a default value.
10. If you prepend a parameter with the reference sign (&) that argument will be passed by reference.
11. Variables within functions have local scope and can not be accessed from outside the function.
12. Use the global keyword to use variables from the global scope within a function.
